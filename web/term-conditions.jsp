                            <p>Please read our “Terms & Conditios” very carefully and learn our all rules. This rules was modified on 8 January 2018</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1/ GENERAL:</strong> These general terms and conditions of sale are between Buyer and Seller, and along with other written specifications, quotations or supplemental terms that may have been provided by Seller, will control the sale of all goods and services (the “Products”) by Seller to Buyer. These terms and conditions apply whether the sale occurs due to verbal or paper-based orders or any form of electronic commerce and represent the entire agreement between Seller and Buyer for that purpose. If not otherwise agreed to, Buyer’s receipt or acceptance of delivery of any of the sold Products alone will constitute its acceptance of these terms and conditions. </li>
                                <li><strong>2/ PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS AND SELECTION:</strong>Any assistance offered Buyer in product recommendations and selection is advisory only. Buyer must evaluate all specification and application considerations to determine suitability for intended use. SELLER SPECIFICALLY MAKES NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE.</li>
                                <li><strong>3/ ACCEPTANCE OF ORDER; TERMINATION.</strong>Acceptance of any order is subject to credit approval and acceptance of order by Seller and, when applicable Seller’s suppliers. If Buyer’s Credit becomes unsatisfactory to Seller, Seller reserves the right to terminate upon notice to Buyer and without liability to Seller.</li>
                                <li><strong>4/ PAYMENT TERMS. </strong>Payment in advance of shipment is required unless open account credit terms have been established and maintained consistent with Seller’s credit policies. Seller may render partial invoices and require progressive payments or other forms of payment security. Seller also may render invoices electronically and require payment by way of electronic funds transfer. Payment by credit card, when permitted by Seller, is subject to credit card validation and authorization both at time of order placement and immediately prior to shipment. Seller reserves the right to suspend its performance in the event payment is not made when due. No payment by offset is permitted without Seller’s consent. Interest charges will be added to overdue invoices at the rate of 1.5% per month starting from the date of invoice, subject to any limit imposed by applicable law. If Buyer’s account is placed with an attorney for collection, Buyer agrees to pay all costs of collection, including attorney’s fees. If a judgment is obtained, interest shall continue at the greater of 18% per annum or the maximum allowed by law until paid in full.</li>
                                <li><strong>5/ DELIVERY TERMS. </strong>Delivery terms are FOB Seller’s facility (or Seller’s supplier’s facility in the event of a direct factory shipment) or as otherwise agreed to as stated on Seller’s order acknowledgment. In all cases, title transfers to Buyer upon the earlier of Seller’s delivery to Buyer or receipt by the first carrier for transport to Buyer, except that title to all intellectual property rights associated with the Products remains with Seller’s suppliers or Product licensors. Where applicable, prepaid shipping will be billed to Buyer as a separate invoice item. Claims for shortages, errors, or unsatisfactory stock must be made in writing not more than five (5) days after receipt of shipment.</li>
                                <li><strong>6/ WARRANTY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISCLAIMER.</strong>Buyer acknowledges that Seller is an independent enterprise, purchasing and reselling the Products for Seller’s own account, and not as an agent of any product manufacturer or service provider. Seller is not authorized to commit or bind any product manufacturer or third-party service provider in any way, nor is any product manufacturer or service provider authorized to commit or bind Seller in any way. Seller is not a general contractor regarding the sale of third-party branded services, acting only in the capacity of a permitted reseller of those services. SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS, PROVIDE NO INDEMNITIES (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHERWISE), AND DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATIVE TO ANY GOODS OR SERVICES SOLD BY IT. THE ONLY WARRANTY AVAILABLE TO BUYER WILL BE THAT EXTENDED DIRECTLY BY THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT MANUFACTURER OR SERVICE PROVIDER</li>
                                <li><strong>7/ DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SELLER WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, MATERIALS, ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, DATA, CONTRACT, GOODWILL OR THE LIKE (WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT IN NATURE) OR FOR ANY OTHER FORM OF INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. SELLER’S MAXIMUM CUMULATIVE LIABILITY RELATIVE TO ALL OTHER CLAIMS AND LIABILITIES FOR WHICH IT IS FOUND RESPONSIBLE, WHETHER OR NOT INSURED, INCLUDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER ANY INDEMNITY, WILL NOT EXCEED SELLER’S SELLING PRICE TO BUYER FOR THE PRODUCT(S) GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR LIABILITY</li>
                                <li><strong>8/ PRICES.</strong>Prices quoted are valid for 30 days unless otherwise specified. Products containing commodity materials (copper, steel, aluminum, resin, etc.) are subject to increase if the commodity price has changed between the quotation date and the order date. Prices and other information shown in any of Seller’s catalogs, brochures and websites (including those of its suppliers) are subject to change without notice and to confirmation by specific quotation. Those publications are not offers to sell and are maintained only as a source of general information. Time and material services will be provided in accordance with Seller’s (or the related service provider’s) published service rates (including applicable overtime and travel expenses) and supplemental terms and conditions in effect as of the date the services are provided, unless otherwise confirmed by Seller’s written quotation or order acknowledgment.</li>
                                <li><strong>9/ TAXES.</strong>Seller’s prices do not include sales, use, excise, customs, value-added or similar taxes. Buyer will pay or reimburse Seller for all such taxes as may be applicable or provide Seller with acceptable tax exemption certificate. Buyer indemnifies Seller against any costs or losses, including attorney fees, arising from any improper designation of tax status.</li>
                                <li><strong>10/ ORDER CANCELLATION.</strong>Cancellation by Buyer prior to shipment is permitted only by written notice from Buyer and subsequent written acceptance by Seller and upon payment to Seller of reasonable cancellation and restocking charges, including reimbursement for incurred direct costs. Cancellation charges associated with orders for custom Products, Products specifically manufactured or sourced to Buyer’s specification, or orders requiring a commitment to obtain raw materials may equal the actual selling price of the affected Products. Seller has the right to cancel any order for cause at any time by written notice, and Seller will be entitled to cancellation and restocking charges as mentioned above. No termination by Buyer for cause will be effective unless Seller has failed to correct the alleged cause within forty‑five (45) days after receipt of Buyer’s written notice specifying the cause.</li>
